# Sharpe-Ratio-AL

This project focuses on enhancing the Sharpe ratio calculation process by integrating liquidity adjustments and considering holding periods, particularly in low liquidity markets.

The Sharpe Ratio has traditionally been used as a key tool for assessing the risk-adjusted return of an asset. However, in low liquidity markets, where timely asset liquidation can be challenging due to a lack of willing counterparties, this approach may not be sufficient.

We propose an innovative model that adjusts the Sharpe ratio calculation by considering not only asset returns and volatility but also liquidity and estimated holding periods. This involves integrating a liquidity regularization into the Sharpe Ratio function.
